This is the Duck Life Game! It allows a user to select between three levels. Once a level is selected, the user is taken to the game play page, which displays a duck. The screen moves and new obstacles
are generated and arrive from the right side of the screen. The user can either press the up arrow to jump the obstacle or the down arrow to go underneath the obstacle. The user can also press the left and 
right arrows to accelerate to the left or right. The player can collect coins, and a sound is produced when collected. The coins collected and timer is displayed on the top. If the duck jumps on an obstacle that requires the duck to go underneath or goes underneath on an obstacle that requires a jump, it will get stuck and move off of the screen, making the player lose. All actions are based on physics 
concepts (i.e. drag force is applied when the duck goes underneath, gravitational force is applied during the jump, acceleration is applied when left/right arrow buttons are pressed, etc).
